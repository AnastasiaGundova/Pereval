# REST API for the Pereval application
## A fully functional project written in Python and Django that makes it possible to add information about various mountain passes

### Description:
The project was developed for the "ФСТР" ( Russian Sports Tourism Federation ) (site - https://pereval.online/) to maintain a base of mountain passes, which is filled with tourists. In the mountains, people will enter data about the pass into the application and send it to the "ФСТР" as soon as Internet access is available. A moderator from the federation will verify and enter information received from users into the database, and they, in turn, will be able to see the moderation status in the mobile application and view the database with objects entered by others.
